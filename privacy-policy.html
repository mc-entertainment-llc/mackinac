      STORING AND PROCESSING YOUR PERSONAL DATA
      <br />
      <br />
      We store our gathered information and will do our best to keep it secure.<br />
      We process personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may process your personal
      information on a server located outside the country where you live or travel. We take all reasonable processes to
      ensure your data is secure and in agreement with our Privacy Policy as outlined here. We use secured servers to
      ensure proper data storage. All communication containing personal information is kept encrypted for safety
      measures.<br />
      While we take steps to keep your data secure, transmission of data on the Internet can never be ultimately
      secure. We do not and cannot guarantee security of information collected electronically or transmitted and you
      agree to not hold us liable per your acceptance of this Privacy Policy. As a result of our inability to guarantee
      safety, you are submitting information to us at your own risk. Where needed a password may be necessary to access
      areas of our apps or website. You are responsible for the safety and confidentiality of the password you
      generate.
      <br />
      <br />
      HOW LONG WILL YOU USE MY PERSONAL DATA FOR?
      <br />
      <br />
      We will only retain your personal data for as long as you have an account with the Application. If you decide to
      delete your account with the Application then we will delete the data we process about you.
      <br />
      <br />
      To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity
      of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the
      purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means,
      and the applicable legal requirements.

      <br />
      In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see Request erasure below for further information.
      <br />
      <br />

      research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to
      you.
