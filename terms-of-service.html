      OUR RESPONSIBILITY FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE SUFFERED BY YOU

      places to eat, drink, experience and explore but we do not assume any responsibility whatsoever for your safety
      if
      you choose to go to somewhere that has been recommended in the App and we are not liable for death or injury
      caused by the negligence of any of the recommended places.
      <br />
      <br />
      We are not liable for business losses. The App is for domestic and private use. If you use the App for any
      commercial, business or resale purpose we will have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business,

      <br />
      Limitations to the App and the Services. The App and the Services are provided for general information and
      entertainment purposes only. They do not offer advice on which you should rely. You must obtain professional or
      specialist advice before taking, or refraining from, any action on the basis of information obtained from the App
      or the Service. Although we make reasonable efforts to update the information provided by the App and the
      Service,
      we make no representations, warranties or guarantees, whether express or implied, that such information is
      accurate, complete or up to date.
      <br />
      <br />
      Please backup content and data used with the App. We recommend that you backup any content and data used in

      <br />
      Check that the App and the Services are suitable for you. The App and the Services have not been developed to
      meet
      your individual requirements. Please check that the facilities and functions of the App and the Services (as
      described on the app store site and in the Documentation) meet your requirements.
      <br />
      <br />
      We are not responsible for events outside our control. If our provision of the Services or support for the App or
      the Services is delayed by an event outside our control then we will contact you as soon as possible to let you
      know and we will take steps to minimise the effect of the delay. Provided we do this we will not be liable for
      delays caused by the event but if there is a risk of substantial delay you may contact us to end your contract
      with us and receive a refund for any Services you have paid for but not received.
      <br />
      <br />
      WE MAY END YOUR RIGHTS TO USE THE APP AND THE SERVICES IF YOU BREAK THESE TERMS
      <br />
      <br />
      We may end your rights to use the App and Services at any time by contacting you if you have broken these terms
      in
      a serious way. If what you have done can be put right we will give you a reasonable opportunity to do so.
      <br />
      <br />
      If we end your rights to use the App and Services:
      <br />
      <br />
      You must stop all activities authorised by these terms, including your use of the App and any Services.<br />
      You must delete or remove the App from all devices in your possession and immediately destroy all copies of the
      App which you have and confirm to us that you have done this.<br />
      We may remotely access your devices and remove the App from them and cease providing you with access to the
      Services.<br />
      WE MAY TRANSFER THIS AGREEMENT TO SOMEONE ELSE
      <br />
      <br />
      We may transfer our rights and obligations under these terms to another organisation. We will always tell you in
      writing if this happens and we will ensure that the transfer will not affect your rights under the contract.
      <br />
      <br />
      YOU NEED OUR CONSENT TO TRANSFER YOUR RIGHTS TO SOMEONE ELSE
      <br />
      <br />
      You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under these terms to another person if we agree in writing.
      <br />
      <br />
      NO RIGHTS FOR THIRD PARTIES
      <br />
      <br />
      This agreement does not give rise to any rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce
      any term of this agreement.
      <br />
      <br />
      IF A COURT FINDS PART OF THIS CONTRACT ILLEGAL, THE REST WILL CONTINUE IN FORCE
      <br />
      <br />
      Each of the paragraphs of these terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of
      them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.
      <br />
      <br />
      EVEN IF WE DELAY IN ENFORCING THIS CONTRACT, WE CAN STILL ENFORCE IT LATER
      <br />
      <br />
      Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later. If we do not insist immediately that
      you do anything you are required to do under these terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect
      of
      your breaking this contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent
      us
      taking steps against you at a later date.
      <br />
      <br />
      WHICH LAWS APPLY TO THIS CONTRACT AND WHERE YOU MAY BRING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
      <br />
      <br />
      These terms are governed by English law and you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the products in the
      English courts. If you live in Scotland you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the products in either the
      Scottish or the English courts. If you live in Northern Ireland you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the
      products in either the Northern Irish or the English courts.
      <br />
      <br />
      ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION
      <br />
      <br />
      Alternative dispute resolution is a process where an independent body considers the facts of a dispute and seeks
      to resolve it, without you having to go to court. If you are not happy with how we have handled any complaint,
      the
      Parties must first attempt to resolve the dispute using a reputable alternative dispute resolution provider in
      London. In addition, please note that disputes may be submitted for online resolution to the European Commission
      Online Dispute Resolution platform.

      to update the App for these reasons.
      <br />
      <br />
      If you choose not to install such updates or if you opt out of automatic updates you may not be able to continue
      using the App and the Services.
      <br />
      <br />
      IF SOMEONE ELSE OWNS THE PHONE OR DEVICE YOU ARE USING
      <br />
      <br />
      If you download or stream the App onto any phone or other device not owned by you, you must have the owner’s
      permission to do so. You will be responsible for complying with these terms, whether or not you own the phone or
      other device.
      <br />
      <br />
      WE MAY COLLECT TECHNICAL DATA ABOUT YOUR DEVICE
      <br />
      <br />
      By using the App or any of the Services, you agree to us collecting and using technical information about the
      devices you use the App on and related software, hardware and, peripherals to improve our products and to provide
      any Services to you.
      <br />
      <br />
      WE MAY COLLECT LOCATION DATA
      <br />
      <br />
      Certain Services will make use of location data sent from your devices. You can turn off this functionality at
      any
      time by turning off the location services settings for the App on the device but please note that the App may not
      perform properly without location services since the App is very much dependent on your location. If you use
      these
      Services, you consent to us and our affiliates’ and licensees’ transmission, collection, retention, maintenance,
      processing and use of your location data and queries to provide and improve location-based products and services.
      You may stop us from collecting such data at any time by turning off your location services settings.
      <br />
      <br />
      WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR OTHER WEBSITES YOU LINK TO
      <br />
      <br />
      The App or any Service may contain links to other independent websites which are not provided by us. Such
      independent sites are not under our control, and we are not responsible for and have not checked and approved
      their content or their privacy policies (if any).
      <br />
      <br />
      You will need to make your own independent judgment about whether to use any such independent sites, including
      whether to buy any products or services offered by them.
      <br />

      places to eat, drink, experience and explore but we do not assume any responsibility whatsoever for your safety
      if
      you choose to go to somewhere that has been recommended in the App and we are not liable for death or injury
      caused by the negligence of any of the recommended places.
      <br />
      <br />
      We are not liable for business losses. The App is for domestic and private use. If you use the App for any

      <br />
      Limitations to the App and the Services. The App and the Services are provided for general information and
      entertainment purposes only. They do not offer advice on which you should rely. You must obtain professional or
      specialist advice before taking, or refraining from, any action on the basis of information obtained from the App
      or the Service. Although we make reasonable efforts to update the information provided by the App and the

      we make no representations, warranties or guarantees, whether express or implied, that such information is
      accurate, complete or up to date.
      <br />
      <br />
      Please backup content and data used with the App. We recommend that you backup any content and data used in
      connection with the App, to protect yourself in case of problems with the App or the Service.

      <br />
      Check that the App and the Services are suitable for you. The App and the Services have not been developed to
      meet
      your individual requirements. Please check that the facilities and functions of the App and the Services (as
      described on the app store site and in the Documentation) meet your requirements.
      <br />
      <br />
      We are not responsible for events outside our control. If our provision of the Services or support for the App or
      the Services is delayed by an event outside our control then we will contact you as soon as possible to let you
      know and we will take steps to minimise the effect of the delay. Provided we do this we will not be liable for
      delays caused by the event but if there is a risk of substantial delay you may contact us to end your contract
      with us and receive a refund for any Services you have paid for but not received.
      <br />
      <br />
      WE MAY END YOUR RIGHTS TO USE THE APP AND THE SERVICES IF YOU BREAK THESE TERMS
      <br />
      <br />
      We may end your rights to use the App and Services at any time by contacting you if you have broken these terms
      in
      a serious way. If what you have done can be put right we will give you a reasonable opportunity to do so.
      <br />
      <br />
      If we end your rights to use the App and Services:
      <br />
      <br />
      You must stop all activities authorised by these terms, including your use of the App and any Services.<br />
      You must delete or remove the App from all devices in your possession and immediately destroy all copies of the
      App which you have and confirm to us that you have done this.<br />
      We may remotely access your devices and remove the App from them and cease providing you with access to the
      Services.<br />
      WE MAY TRANSFER THIS AGREEMENT TO SOMEONE ELSE
      <br />
      <br />
      We may transfer our rights and obligations under these terms to another organisation. We will always tell you in
      writing if this happens and we will ensure that the transfer will not affect your rights under the contract.
      <br />
      <br />
      YOU NEED OUR CONSENT TO TRANSFER YOUR RIGHTS TO SOMEONE ELSE
      <br />
      <br />
      You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under these terms to another person if we agree in writing.
      <br />
      <br />
      NO RIGHTS FOR THIRD PARTIES
      <br />
      <br />
      This agreement does not give rise to any rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce
      any term of this agreement.
      <br />
      <br />
      IF A COURT FINDS PART OF THIS CONTRACT ILLEGAL, THE REST WILL CONTINUE IN FORCE
      <br />
      <br />
      Each of the paragraphs of these terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of
      them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.
      <br />
      <br />
      EVEN IF WE DELAY IN ENFORCING THIS CONTRACT, WE CAN STILL ENFORCE IT LATER
      <br />
      <br />
      Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later. If we do not insist immediately that
      you do anything you are required to do under these terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect
      of
      your breaking this contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent
      us
      taking steps against you at a later date.
      <br />
      <br />
      WHICH LAWS APPLY TO THIS CONTRACT AND WHERE YOU MAY BRING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
      <br />
      <br />
      These terms are governed by English law and you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the products in the
      English courts. If you live in Scotland you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the products in either the
      Scottish or the English courts. If you live in Northern Ireland you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the
      products in either the Northern Irish or the English courts.
      <br />
      <br />
      ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION
      <br />
      <br />
      Alternative dispute resolution is a process where an independent body considers the facts of a dispute and seeks
      to resolve it, without you having to go to court. If you are not happy with how we have handled any complaint,
      the
      Parties must first attempt to resolve the dispute using a reputable alternative dispute resolution provider in
      London. In addition, please note that disputes may be submitted for online resolution to the European Commission
      Online Dispute Resolution platform.
