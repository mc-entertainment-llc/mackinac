APPLE’S and GOOGLE’S TERMS ALSO APPLY

The ways in which you can use the App and Documentation may also be controlled by the App Store (<a href="//developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines" target="_blank">https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/</a>) and Google Play Store’s rules and policies (<a href="//play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy/#!?modal_active=none" target="_blank" >https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy/#!?modal_active=none</a>), which will apply instead of these terms where there are differences between the two.


ADDITIONAL EXPENSES

In the different tours that we offer in the Mackinac Island App, we have included locations that require an admission fee. Those admission fee costs are not included in the purchase of the Mackinac Island App. Terms and conditions specified by the third party might apply upon entering the location.

Whilst you may have sharing rights, you may not otherwise transfer the App or the Service to someone else, whether for money, for anything else or for free. If you sell any device on which the App is installed, you must remove the App from it.


CHANGES TO THESE TERMS

We may at any time change these terms to reflect changes in law or best practice or to deal with additional features which we introduce.

If you do not accept the notified changes you will not be permitted to continue to use the App and the Service.


UPDATE TO THE APP AND CHANGES TO THE SERVICE

From time to time we may automatically update the App and change the Service to improve performance, enhance functionality, reflect changes to the operating system or address security issues. Alternatively, we may ask you to update the App for these reasons.

If you choose not to install such updates or if you opt out of automatic updates you may not be able to continue using the App and the Services.


IF SOMEONE ELSE OWNS THE PHONE OR DEVICE YOU ARE USING

If you download or stream the App onto any phone or other device not owned by you, you must have the owner’s permission to do so. You will be responsible for complying with these terms, whether or not you own the phone or other device.


WE MAY COLLECT TECHNICAL DATA ABOUT YOUR DEVICE

By using the App or any of the Services, you agree to us collecting and using technical information about the devices you use the App on and related software, hardware and peripherals to improve our products and to provide any Services to you.


WE MAY COLLECT LOCATION DATA

Certain Services will make use of location data sent from your devices. You can turn off this functionality at any time by turning off the location services settings for the App on the device but please note that the App may not perform properly without location services since the App is very much dependent on your location. If you use these Services, you consent to us and our affiliates’ and licensees’ transmission, collection, retention, maintenance, processing and use of your location data and queries to provide and improve location-based products and services. You may stop us from collecting such data at any time by turning off your location services settings.


WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR OTHER WEBSITES YOU LINK TO

The App or any Service may contain links to other independent websites which are not provided by us. Such independent sites are not under our control, and we are not responsible for and have not checked and approved their content or their privacy policies (if any).


You will need to make your own independent judgment about whether to use any such independent sites, including whether to buy any products or services offered by them.


LICENCE RESTRICTIONS

except in the course of permitted sharing, not rent, lease, sub-license, loan, provide, or otherwise make available, the App or the Services in any form, in whole or in part to any person without prior written consent from us;
not copy the App, Documentation or Services, except as part of the normal use of the App or where it is necessary for the purpose of back-up or operational security;

You have no intellectual property rights in, or to, the App, the Documentation or the Services other than the right to use them in accordance with these terms.


OUR RESPONSIBILITY FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE SUFFERED BY YOU

We are not liable for death or injury caused by your negligence. You are entirely responsible for your own safety whilst using the app and must take maximum care when crossing roads and in respect of all other potential hazards whilst taking our walking tours and using the App.

We are not liable for death or injury caused by the negligence of other businesses. In the App, we recommend places to eat, drink, experience and explore but we do not assume any responsibility whatsoever for your safety if you choose to go to somewhere that has been recommended in the App and we are not liable for death or injury caused by the negligence of any of the recommended places.

We are not liable for business losses. The App is for domestic and private use. If you use the App for any commercial, business or resale purpose we will have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption, or loss of business opportunity.

Limitations to the App and the Services. The App and the Services are provided for general information and entertainment purposes only. They do not offer advice on which you should rely. You must obtain professional or specialist advice before taking, or refraining from, any action on the basis of information obtained from the App or the Service. Although we make reasonable efforts to update the information provided by the App and the Service, we make no representations, warranties or guarantees, whether express or implied, that such information is accurate, complete or up to date.

Please backup content and data used with the App. We recommend that you backup any content and data used in connection with the App, to protect yourself in case of problems with the App or the Service.

Check that the App and the Services are suitable for you. The App and the Services have not been developed to meet your individual requirements. Please check that the facilities and functions of the App and the Services (as described on the app store site and in the Documentation) meet your requirements.


We are not responsible for events outside our control. If our provision of the Services or support for the App or the Services is delayed by an event outside our control then we will contact you as soon as possible to let you know and we will take steps to minimise the effect of the delay. Provided we do this we will not be liable for delays caused by the event but if there is a risk of substantial delay you may contact us to end your contract with us and receive a refund for any Services you have paid for but not received.


WE MAY END YOUR RIGHTS TO USE THE APP AND THE SERVICES IF YOU BREAK THESE TERMS

We may end your rights to use the App and Services at any time by contacting you if you have broken these terms in a serious way. If what you have done can be put right we will give you a reasonable opportunity to do so.

If we end your rights to use the App and Services:

You must stop all activities authorised by these terms, including your use of the App and any Services.
You must delete or remove the App from all devices in your possession and immediately destroy all copies of the App which you have and confirm to us that you have done this.
We may remotely access your devices and remove the App from them and cease providing you with access to the Services.


WE MAY TRANSFER THIS AGREEMENT TO SOMEONE ELSE

We may transfer our rights and obligations under these terms to another organisation. We will always tell you in writing if this happens and we will ensure that the transfer will not affect your rights under the contract.


YOU NEED OUR CONSENT TO TRANSFER YOUR RIGHTS TO SOMEONE ELSE

You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under these terms to another person if we agree in writing.


NO RIGHTS FOR THIRD PARTIES

This agreement does not give rise to any rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term of this agreement.


IF A COURT FINDS PART OF THIS CONTRACT ILLEGAL, THE REST WILL CONTINUE IN FORCE

Each of the paragraphs of these terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.


EVEN IF WE DELAY IN ENFORCING THIS CONTRACT, WE CAN STILL ENFORCE IT LATER

Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later. If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking this contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us from taking steps against you at a later date.


WHICH LAWS APPLY TO THIS CONTRACT AND WHERE YOU MAY BRING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

These terms are governed by Michigan, United States of American law and you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the products in Michigan, United States of America courts.
